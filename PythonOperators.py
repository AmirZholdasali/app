Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
Python divides the operators in the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
Bitwise operators


Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

Operator	Name	        Example
  +	      Addition	        x + y	
  -	      Subtraction	    x - y	
  *	      Multiplication	x * y	
  /	      Division	        x / y	
  %	      Modulus	        x % y	
  **	Exponentiation	    x ** y	
  //	Floor division	    x // y

  
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

Operator	Example	        Same As
=	        x = 5	        x = 5	
+=	        x += 3	        x = x + 3	
-=	        x -= 3	        x = x - 3	
*=	        x *= 3	        x = x * 3	
/=	        x /= 3	        x = x / 3	
%=	        x %= 3	        x = x % 3	
//=	        x //= 3	        x = x // 3	
**=	        x **= 3	        x = x ** 3	
&=	        x &= 3	        x = x & 3	
|=	        x |= 3	        x = x | 3	
^=	        x ^= 3	        x = x ^ 3	
>>=	        x >>= 3	        x = x >> 3	
<<=	        x <<= 3	        x = x << 3	
:=	        print(x := 3)	x = 3
                            print(x)

                            
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

Operator	Name	                    Example
==	        Equal	                    x == y	
!=	        Not equal	                x != y	
>	        Greater than	            x > y	
<	        Less than	                x < y	
>=	        Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=	        Less than or equal to	    x <= y
